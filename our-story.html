            <p>
                Ana for Women is a great initiative that promotes the objective of changing
                the attitudes of people about menstruation and sanitary napkins. It focuses
                on imparting knowledge about menstrual hygiene and management among young
                girls in the remote areas of India. The project is headed by Ana and the
                project plans to take forward the personal hygiene for women, by conducting
                workshops and providing franchises.

                Adolescence in girls is a very special period as it is a transition from
                girlhood to womanhood; however menstruation is an important sign of
                adolescence. Menstruation is defined as “the process in a woman of
                discharging blood and other material from the lining of the uterus at
                intervals of about one lunar month from puberty until the menopause, except
                during pregnancy.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “52% of women worldwide are in reproductive age and most of them thus are
                menstruating monthly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, the majority of them are not in conditions to take care of their
                menstruation in a hygienic manner or are impaired by it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                But unfortunately, menstruation is supposed to be invisible and silent.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Mission and Vision</h3>
            <p>
                We at Ana for Women plan to provide adequate knowledge about sanitary
                napkins to women in the remote areas of the country. Our organisation
                Golden Wings provide durable and cheap pads for women who cannot afford the
                expensive ones and are still using cloth. We all know that there are
                several diseases that arise by using cloth, as it is not sanitised.
                Therefore, using Golden Wings pads, women can shift from cloth to sanitary
                napkins. We also encourage women who want to work by encouraging other
                women to use Golden Wings sanitary napkins.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sanitary napkins made by Golden Wings are not expensive and are high
                quality; therefore women can purchase them without hesitation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care
                of your day to day activities. A little negligence in menstrual hygiene
                management can cause your body grievous harm and you may also act as an
                instrument for the spread of infection to others.
